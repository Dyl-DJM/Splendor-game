# Splendor game

The purpose of this project was to make an app representing the Splendor game using the Java principles.

Among a two dev team, we had to write a game following the real rules from the Splendor boardgame using the Java language.

We had more than 2 months in addition to our studies to create a game with many play modes :

- User vs User
- User vs AI

Moreover, we had two ways of display to implement :

- ASCII art display in the console
- Graphical interface (thanks to the Zen5 lib)















## How to use the project

The way the app must be used by a customer is listed in the user file.

=> **docs/user.pdf**

In addition, there is a small video showing the graphical interface we made : https://youtu.be/Iv8C4MyzDCY




## Implementation choices

All the information about the choices, structures, the path we followed to reach these final result is gathered in the dev document.

=> **docs/dev.pdf**


## Optimizations

The optimization we could provide are mainly about the code structure to make it more understandlable.

We could improve the graphical quality of our game which is very basic at the moment, and add the commands inside the graphic window instead of the console.

Moreoever, the IA part could be improved to make smarter choices against the user.
